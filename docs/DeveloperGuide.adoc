By: `CS2103T W11-3 Team`      Since: `Feb 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.travel.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePlace.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The *layout* of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The 'UI' component *controllers* are found in the `src/main/java/seedu/address/ui` folder. Each class corresponds to a specific `.fxml` file.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PlaceListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

*Brief overview* of each UI Component:

`MainWindow`: Consists of the main menu with `File` and `Help` dropdowns and the remaining UI parts below.

`MainWindow`: Webview to display UserGuide.html

`CommandBox`: Directly below the main menu, CLI displayed here

`ResultDisplay`: Displays CLI feedback to user, (eg. `Unknown command`, `Invalid command format!`)

`StatusBarFooter`: At the bottom of MainWindow, reports the status of the TravelBudy application

`PlaceListPanel`: On the left of BrowserPanel, a VBox of PlaceListCards

`PlaceListCard`: Labels for the Display index and Place data fields (CountryCode, Rating etc.) in a VBox the left,
Labels that display Name and actual Place data (CountryCode, Rating etc) in a VBox on the right.

`BrowserPanel`: Opens on clicking the PlaceListCard, on the right of the PlaceListPanel.
Currently (v1.2), opens up a Webview and displays a html placeholder page.

For the next release (v1.3), `BrowserPanel` will display an expanded view of
all Place data. Photo attachments to be included here as well in future releases (beyond v1.3).

*All CSS code are found in DarkTheme.css and Extensions.css

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a place).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Place>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Place` can reference. This would allow `Address
 Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Place` needing their own `Tag` object. An
 example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th place in the address book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new place. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()
`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the place was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the place being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::search[]
=== Search Feature
==== Current Implementation

The following diagram shows how the search feature works:

image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
Figure 3.2.1.1 Sequence Diagram for `search` command

The control flow of the sequence diagram above is as follows:

. A command with the command word `search` followed by argument(s) is used entered by the user.
. `LogicManager` receives the `execute` command and calls the `parseCommand` method in `TravelBuddyParser`.
. `TravelBuddyParser` parses `search` as the command and a `SearchCommandParser` will be instantiated to further parse the command.
. `SearchCommandParser` receives the fields if at least one field is provided, a NameContainsKeywordPredicate will be instantiated with the fields as the predicate.
. `SearchCommand` will be created and returned to `LogicManager`.
. The `execute` command of `SearchCommand` is then called by `LogicManager`.
. The list is updated in the `Model` by `SearchCommand`.
. A `CommandResult` is instantiated and returned to `LogicManager`.

The search feature comprises of:

* `Search by Name`
* `Search by Rating`
* `Search by Tags`
* `Search by Country`
* `Search by Year`

The various search features are differentiated by the `Parser` which is called using different command words and the `Predicate` to filter arguments.

===== Search Name Feature
The command word for search name is `search` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchCommandParser`.

The name arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the names of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search name mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the name of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places.

image::UIsearch.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `search Singapore` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `Singapore` in its name.
The user input will be passed into `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses `TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `search`, `SearchCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchCommand`.
The parsed arguments will be used as a predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `search` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input.

image::UIsearchresults.png[width="800"]

===== Search Rating Feature
The command word for search rating is `searchr` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchRatingCommandParser`.

The rating arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `RatingContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the rating of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search rating mechanism is facilitated by `SearchRatingCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the rating of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search rating mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places.

pimage::UIsearchrating.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `searchr 4` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `4` as its rating.
The user input will be passed into `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses `TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since
the argument is `searchr`, `SearchRatingCommandParser#parse(arguments)` will be called to parse the arguments to be
used in `SearchRatingCommand`.
The parsed arguments will be used as a predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `searchr` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

[NOTE]
The arguments for `searchr` range from 1 to 5. Non-integer values outside the range are not recognised by the application.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input.

image::UIsearchratingresults.png[width="800"]

===== Search Tags Feature
The command word for search tags is `searcht` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchTagsCommandParser`.

The tags arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the tags of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search tags mechanism is facilitated by `SearchTagsCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the tags of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search tags mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places.

image::UIsearchtags.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `searcht distillery` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `distillery`
as its tag. The user input will be passed into `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses
`TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `searcht`, `SearchTagsCommandParser#parse(arguments)`
will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchTagsCommand`. The parsed arguments will be used as a
predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

[NOTE]
The command `searcht` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input.

image::UIsearchtagsresults.png[width="800"]

===== Search Country Feature
The command word for search country is `searchc` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchCountryCommandParser`.

The country code arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `CountryCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the country code of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search country mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCountryCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the country code of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search country mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places.

image::UIsearchcountry.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `searchc SGP JPN` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `SGP` or `JPN`
as its country. The `searchc` command will call `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses
`TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `searchc`, `SearchCountryCommandParser#parse(arguments)`
will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchCountryCommand`. The parsed arguments will be used as a
predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

image::UIsearchcountryresults.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The command `searchc` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

[NOTE]
The country code arguments for `searchc` must be valid 3-letter ISO-3166 country codes.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input.

===== Search Year Feature
The command word for search year is `searchyear` and is parsed by `TravelBuddyParser`. The arguments are then passed into `SearchYearCommandParser`.

The year arguments entered by the user are stored in a list of keywords and passed into `YearContainsKeywordsPredicate`, where the list is converted into a stream and individually matched to the year of visit of each entry in TravelBuddy.

The search year mechanism is facilitated by `SearchYearCommand`, which extends `Command` with a predicate that specifies the conditions of the year of visit of the place to be chosen from TravelBuddy.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search year mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with the user's list of places.

image::UIsearchyear.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `searchyear 2016` command to search for all entries in TravelBuddy with `2016`
as its year visited. The `searchyear` command will call `LogicManager#execute()`, which in turn uses
`TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()`. Since the argument is `searchyear`, `SearchYearCommandParser#parse(arguments)`
will be called to parse the arguments to be used in `SearchYearCommand`. The parsed arguments will be used as a
predicate to filter out entries that satisfy the predicate to be displayed.

image::UIsearchyearresults.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The command `searchyear` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by the application.

[NOTE]
The year arguments range from 1900 to the current year. A single year, multiple years or a range of years can be passed in as arguments.

Step 3. The filtered list is now displayed according to the requirements set by the user input.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How search executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Matches entire keyword.
** Pros: Easy to implement, searching is fast.
** Cons: Unable to search partial keyword
** Example: `search Singapore` will return `National University of Singapore` but `search Singapor` will not.
* **Alternative 2:** Remove whitespaces and check if the place contains the argument string.
** Pros: Can match partial keywords.
** Cons: Uses more processing power and time during checking.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support search commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the user input keywords and places.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming
developers of our project.
** Cons: Inefficient as the entire list needs to be searched through.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HashMap` to map keywords to each place
** Pros: Faster searching as HashMap lookup runs in O(1) time.
** Cons: Requires more memory as a separate HashMap needs to be stored.
// end::search[]

// tag::countrycode[]
=== Add Feature
The `add` command is used to add a place into TravelBuddy. The user can add the following details related to the
place:

* Name
* Country Code
* Date Visited
* Rating
* Address
* Description
* Tag (Optional)

[NOTE]
The Country Code adheres to the three-letters ISO-3166 standard. The full list of Country Codes can be found in
CountryCodes.adoc

==== Current Implementation

Given below is a sequence of steps, illustrating the interaction between various classes when the add command is
entered.

image::AddCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]
Figure 10: Add Command Sequence Diagram

Step 1: The user enters the command `add n/NUS Computing cc/SGP dv/10/10/2017 r/3 d/My School a/13 Computing Drive,
117417 t/faculty`.

Step 2: The command is processed by the Logic component, which will then call `LogicManager#execute()`.

Step 3: `TravelBuddyParser#parseCommand()` is invoked, which is also located in the Logic component.

Step 4: `AddCommandParser#AddCommandParser()` is invoked.

Step 5: The `AddCommandParser#parse()` is called and receives the command with the arguments given as a string.

Step 6: The `AddCommandParser` interprets the arguments and constructs an `AddCommand`.

Step 7: The `AddCommand` with a Place specified by the user is returned.

Step 8: The `AddCommand#execute()` method is invoked.

Step 9: The `Model#addPlace()` method is invoked with the argument `toAdd`. The `Model#commitTravelBuddy()` method is
 also invoked.

Step 10: The `TravelBuddy#addPlace()` method is invoked by `Model` with the argument `toAdd`.

Step 11: A result object is returned.

===== Add Command
Given below is an example usage scenario and what the user will see in the GUI.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees the GUI with no places.

image::AddCommandStep1.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user enters the full add command `add n/NUS Computing cc/SGP dv/10/10/2017 r/3 d/My School a/13 Computing Drive,
117417 t/faculty` to add the place to TravelBuddy and presses enter. TravelBuddy will start executing the steps mentioned in Figure 10.

image::AddCommandStep2.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
The command `add` is in lower-case. Mixed-case or upper-case commands are not recognised by TravelBuddy.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to store Country Codes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use enum specified in java.util.Locales.
** Pros: Easy to implement and contains all three-letters country codes specified in ISO-3166.
** Cons: Slightly slow in searching for country code.
* **Alternative 2:** Create own data structure containing most commonly traveled countries in the world.
** Pros: Locating country code in data structure would be faster than Alternative 1.
** Cons: Tedious process of typing out country codes in the data structure.
// end::countrycode[]

// tag::generate[]
=== Generate Feature
The `generate` command is used to generate different charts in the application.

==== Current Implementation
At the GUI, the user enters the `generate` command, without any parameters. The UI takes in the input and passes it
on to `LogicManager#execute()` in the Logic. The`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` is then called, which parses the
command and redirects to the `GenerateCommand` class.

The `GenerateCommand#execute()` in Logic calls on Model to do two things:
.  It stores the different country code found in TravelBuddy as keys, and stores the number of times each country
code appears in TravelBuddy as values.
.  A similar approach is done, except country code is now replaced with rating found in TravelBuddy as keys, and the
number of times each rating appears as values.

Once the two sets of data are obtained, a new Chart object is created. The Chart object displays the data to the user.

==== Future Implementation
For future implementation, the task is to use JavaFX's charting library to create a chart that can be displayed
to the user, as seen in the figure below.

image::Ui.png[width="800"]

Furthermore, the `generate` command will have user input to specify if they want to generate either a chart by
country or a chart by rating.

// end::generate[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and
logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See
<<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead
of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the
configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more
flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to
preview the end result of your edits. Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows
you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as
Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc
files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google
 Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best
results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor
.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project
are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc
attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and
used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and
experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to
platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.travel.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.travel.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be
 working). +
e.g. `seedu.travel.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are
connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.travel.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, TravelBuddy depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
