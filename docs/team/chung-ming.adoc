== PROJECT: TravelBuddy
---
== Overview

This document serves to highlight my contributions to *TravelBuddy*, a travel log application that lets users efficiently manage their travel records, i.e. the places that they have visited. Additional features built into TravelBuddy allows them to search through the records, attach photos and view statistical models. This project is part of the CS2103 Software Engineering module in NUS, in which link:https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-3.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[my team and I] were tasked to morph a given link:https://se-education.org/addressbook-level4/[addressbook] product into a new product -- TravelBuddy. The complete source code for TravelBuddy is available on link:{repoURL}[GitHub].

My role was to design the chart feature. The following sections describes these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of Contributions

=== Major Enhancement
The major enhancement I did was adding the ability to generate charts in real-time and via the `generate` command, details of which can be found below:

*What it does:* It allows users to generate charts based on their travel data that they have accumulated in the product.

*Justification:* This feature allows users to gather insights into their travel patterns. It improves the user-friendliness of the product, gives the product additional functionality and is the differentiating factor among other travel log products on the market.

*Highlights:* Due to the real-time update of the charts, this enhancement affects existing and future commands. Furthermore, the complexity of this enhancement is due to the fact that it links up with all the components of the existing architecture, as described below:

* *Logic:* The chart feature can be activated via the `generate` command. Hence, a parser is required to parse the command.
* *Model:* Any changes made to the travel records has to be reflected in the charts. Hence, relevant data is extracted from the latest version of the travel records.
* *Storage:* The extracted data has to be stored into the charts' respective JSON files.
* *User Interface (UI):* The charts have to be displayed to the users.

The enhancement required an in-depth analysis of various design alternatives. The challenge was to redesign the architecture to suit the enhancement while still maintaining the integrity of other existing commands and features.

*Credits:* link:https://github.com/google/gson[Gson], a third-party library, was used in the enhancement of this product to convert Java Objects into JSON and back.

*Code contributed to major enhancement*: [link:{repoURL}/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Achung-ming+-label%3Atype.MinorEnhancement+-label%3Atype.Testing[Functional code]] [link:{repoURL}/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Achung-ming+label%3Atype.Testing[Test code]]

=== Minor Enhancement

The minor enhancement I did was to convert the `add` command's Email parameter in the previous addressbook product to a Description parameter in the current product.
