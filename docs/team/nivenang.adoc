== Overview

This project portfolio documents my contribution to *TravelBuddy*, a travel log application developed as a https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-3.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[team] project for the module CS2103T Software Engineering in the National University of Singapore.
As part of the module objectives, a brown-field approach was adopted where we were tasked to morph the given https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook] into the current https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-3.github.io/main/[TravelBuddy], a travel log application for travel enthusiasts to record and manage previously visited places.

My role in this project was to design and write the code for the `search` feature. The following sections showcase, in greater detail, my contributions to TravelBuddy,
as well as the documentation of my contributions in the User Guide and Developer Guide.

== Summary of Contributions

=== Major Enhancement
The major enhancement I added was the ability to perform search by name, rating, tags, country and year on the places in TravelBuddy.

*What it does:* The search feature allows the user to search TravelBuddy for places where the requested field (name, rating, tags, country or year) matches the user input.

*Justification:* TravelBuddy can get long and cluttered when more places are added. This feature improves TravelBuddy as it allows users to filter through the long place list to obtain the relevant data that they need.

*Highlights:* This feature helps users search for what they need. Multiple keywords can be included in the search to obtain a wider scope of results.
The challenge lies in the parsing of the user input, which is tested against a predicate for matching keywords. As user input is taken in, defensive programming is adopted to restrict user input to a fixed regular expression depending on the parameter involved to prevent abuse. This verified input is then tested against a predicate that is tailored to suit the regular expression of each parameter.

An in-depth analysis of design alternatives in keyword matching and the data structure used for the search feature was done to obtain the most optimal solution.

=== Minor Enhancement
The minor enhancement I did was to convert the `Phone` parameter in the previous addressbook to the `Rating` parameter for the `Place` class to track ratings of each place in TravelBuddy.

In addition, I added the `delete multiple` feature to delete multiple entries in TravelBuddy with one command.
