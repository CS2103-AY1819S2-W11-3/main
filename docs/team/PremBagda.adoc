= PROJECT: TravelBuddy

This project portfolio serves to document my contribution to *TravelBuddy*, a desktop application developed as a
Software Engineering team project for the National University of Singapore (NUS) module CS2103T. The
link:https://cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-3.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[team] comprised of 4 NUS computer science students,
including myself.

The application was developed over the span of 8 weeks in Academic Year 18/19 Semester 2 using an iterative approach.
During that time, we
were
asked to morph an existing desktop application link:https://se-education.org/addressbook-level4/[AddressBook Level 4],
which is made up of 10KLoC in Java. One main user requirement was the preference of the user to interact with the
application using Command Line Interface (CLI) rather than a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The final product we
created is link:https://travelbuddy-cs2103.netlify.com/[TravelBuddy], which is detailed below.

'''

== Overview

TravelBuddy is a travel journal desktop application for travel enthusiasts to record places which they have previously
visited. With the recorded data, travellers can search for places visited based on specified filters such as rating
and tags. Using the data, the application can analyse travel history and generate statistics. Users
can also store their
travel photos on TravelBuddy, which can help them remember and reminisce the places they have visited before.

My role in the project was to design and write the code for the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) feature. The
following
sections showcase, in
greater detail, my contributions and enhancements added to TravelBuddy, as well as the documentation of these enhancements in the User Guide and Developer Guide.

== Summary of Contributions

=== Major Enhancement
The major enhancement I added was *the ability to add, list, edit and delete places in Travelbuddy*

*What it does*: It allows users to add, list, edit and delete places in TravelBuddy.

*Justification*: The user needs to be able to add the places into TravelBuddy. When the user applies some filters
such as rating, a limited number of places would be shown. In order for the user to see all the places again, the
list command would be used. The user may make some mistakes when adding a place, for which the edit command can be
used to rectify the mistake. The user may have accidentally added a place, for which the delete command allows the user
to remove the specific place.

*Highlights*: This enhancement involved a large amount of refactoring and careful crafting of test cases to test
thoroughly the Date Visited field.

*Overall code contributed*: link:https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=Prem&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-10&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Commits]

=== Minor Enhancement
The minor enhancement I did was to convert the Person object from the original code base to a Place object.
