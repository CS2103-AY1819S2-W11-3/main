=== Standardizing command formats

The following covers the standard format to be used for all the commands in TravelBuddy and the syntax that follows:

[WARNING]
The code in this section is merely for illustrative purposes. It is kept brief to highlight the formatting standards for all the commands and not the actual commands themselves. Do not copy and paste the commands in this section.

* _Some commands may have a shortcut, which you can use to execute the command._ +
*Example:* For `add`, its shortcut is `a`. Hence, you can either type `add n/Botanic Gardens` or `a n/Botanic Gardens`.

* _Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you have to supply._ +
*Example:* For `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be substituted to be `add n/Botanic Gardens`.

* _Items in square brackets are optional._ +
*Example:* For `add n/NAME [t/TAG]`, it can either be specified as `add n/Botanic Gardens t/faculty` or as `add n/Botanic Gardens`.

* _Parameters can be in any order._ +
*Example:* If the command specifies the parameters `n/NAME r/RATING`, then changing the order to `r/RATING n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* _Whenever there are duplicate parameters, the last duplicated parameter is chosen._ +
*Example:* If the command is `add n/Singapore Zoo n/Botanic Gardens`, where there are duplicates of the `n/NAME` parameters, the last parameter, `n/Botanic Gardens`, is chosen to be added to the list of places.

* _Some parameters have a specific input format_ +
*Example:* For `dv/DATE_VISITED`, the `DATE_VISITED` needs to follow the `DD/MM/YYYY` format.

=== Seeking help: `help`

*Format:* `generate`

*Preconditions:* Given below is a list of preconditions that must be met for the `generate` command to work:

* By default, the charts are automatically generated each time TravelBuddy loads.
* The `generate` command always triggers the display of all three charts, as seen in <<Chart_Combined>>.
* The charts always update themselves in real-time. +
*_Example:_* When a place is added via the `add` command, the charts are automatically updated so that no `generate` command is necessary.
* If the list is empty, the `generate` command will not display any charts (<<Generate_ListIsEmpty>>).
* You can type in any parameters after the `generate` command, TravelBuddy will simply ignore them (<<Generate_BeforeParamAfterParam>>).
