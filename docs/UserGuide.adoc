== Introduction

*TravelBuddy* is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their travel log*. More importantly,
TravelBuddy is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TravelBuddy can get your contact management tasks
done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* *`list`* : lists all places
* **`add`**`n/NUS Computing r/5 d/No Description a/NUS School of Computing, COM1, 13 Computing Drive, 117417` : adds
 a place named

== Features

====
*Command Format*
* Some commands may have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command e.g. for `add`, its alias is `a`, so
 you can either type `add n/NUS Computing` or `a n/NUS Computing`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
which can be used as `add n/NUS Computing`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/NUS Computing t/faculty` or as `n/NUS
Computing`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as
`{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/faculty`, `t/faculty t/school` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME r/RATING`, `r/RATING n/NAME` is
also acceptable.
