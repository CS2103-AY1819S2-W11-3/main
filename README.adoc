TravelBuddy is a desktop Travel Guide application for travel enthusiasts to record places previously visited.

With TravelBuddy, you will be able to have a record of all the places you have visited, describe and rate the
places you have been to, and easily find them when you need it using a CLI (Command Line Interface). TravelBuddy stores all your information offline, so
you can access all your vital travel information even without data connection.
